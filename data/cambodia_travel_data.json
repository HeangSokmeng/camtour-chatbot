    "question": "What currency is used in Cambodia? Should I bring cash?",
    "answer": "Cambodia primarily uses two currencies: the US Dollar (USD) and the Cambodian Riel (KHR), with 4,000 Riel ≈ $1. USD is widely accepted throughout the country, while Riel is usually used for amounts less than $1 as change. Bring clean, crisp USD bills without tears or marks, as damaged notes may be rejected. ATMs are widely available in major cities and tourist areas, dispensing primarily USD with some also offering Riel. Credit cards are accepted in upscale establishments in cities, but cash is essential for markets, tuk-tuks, and rural areas. For best rates, withdraw from ATMs rather than exchanging at hotels, and keep some small USD bills ($1-$5) for daily transactions."

Each evening around sunset (5:30-6:30 PM), millions of bats emerge from caves in the limestone mountain of Phnom Sampeau, creating a dark ribbon across the sky that stretches for kilometers. The bats are insectivores that help local farmers by consuming agricultural pests. To see this spectacle, take a tuk-tuk from Battambang (about $10-15 round trip) to Phnom Sampeau, about 12km from town. The mountain also features Buddhist temples, tragic killing caves from the Khmer Rouge era, and panoramic countryside views. Arrive by 4:00 PM to explore the mountain (entrance fee $3) before heading to the bat viewing area. Bring water, sun protection, and mosquito repellent. Food and drink vendors are available near the viewing area. The experience works well combined with a Bamboo Train visit for a half-day tour.",

    "question": "What are the ethical elephant sanctuaries in Cambodia?",
    "answer": "Ethical elephant sanctuaries in Cambodia include: 1) Elephant Valley Project (Mondulkiri): Pioneer in ethical elephant tourism allowing elephants to roam freely while visitors observe them in their natural habitat. Half-day ($50) and full-day ($85) visits available. 2) Mondulkiri Project (Mondulkiri): Community-based ecotourism project offering 1-2 day experiences ($50-120) where you can walk with, observe, and help wash elephants (no riding). 3) Elephant Community Project (Mondulkiri): Support for indigenous Bunong communities who traditionally worked with elephants, offering half-day and full-day visits ($40-80). 4) Kulen Elephant Forest (near Siem Reap): Newer sanctuary providing retirement for former working elephants, with half-day visits ($80) including transportation from Siem Reap. All ethical sanctuaries prohibit elephant riding, feature rescued elephants, limit direct contact, and support conservation efforts. Advance booking is essential, especially in high season.",

    "question": "How can I avoid crowds at Angkor Wat?",
    "answer": "To avoid crowds at Angkor Wat: 1) Visit during shoulder seasons (April-May or September-November) rather than peak period (December-February). 2) Create a reverse itinerary: start with outer temples while crowds gather at Angkor Wat, then visit Angkor Wat after 2 PM when most tour groups have left. 3) Sunrise isn't crowd-free anymore—try entering Angkor Wat right after sunrise when crowds move to breakfast. 4) For truly quiet experiences, visit during midday heat (11 AM-2 PM) when most tourists take lunch breaks. 5) Explore lesser-known temples like Preah Khan, Ta Som, and Banteay Kdei, which receive fewer visitors. 6) Hire a knowledgeable guide who can take you through alternative entrances and hidden passages. 7) Take a three-day pass and space out your visits, enjoying more relaxed exploration. 8) Stay at hotels closer to the Angkor complex to reach temples early. 9) Explore the east side of Bayon and Angkor Thom, which are less visited.",

    "question": "Is Cambodia suitable for family travel with children?",
    "answer": "Cambodia can be family-friendly with proper planning: 1) Best ages for children are 6+ who can appreciate the cultural sites and manage the tropical climate. 2) Health precautions: Visit a travel doctor before departure, use mosquito protection, carry a basic medical kit, drink bottled water, and be careful with street food for sensitive stomachs. 3) Family-friendly activities include exploring Angkor temples (in short sessions), visiting the Cambodia Landmine Museum, taking countryside bicycle tours, enjoying cooking classes, watching the Phare Circus, taking boat trips on Tonle Sap Lake, participating in hands-on craft workshops, and relaxing at hotel pools. 4) Family accommodations are plentiful in tourist areas with many hotels offering family rooms, connecting rooms, or apartment-style options with pools. 5) Distances between major destinations can be long—consider flying between Phnom Penh and Siem Reap with children. 6) Cambodians are very welcoming to children, though be prepared for friendly attention from locals.",

    "question": "What are important cultural do's and don'ts in Cambodia?",
    "answer": "Important cultural guidelines for Cambodia: DO: 1) Dress modestly, especially at temples and rural areas (shoulders and knees covered). 2) Remove shoes and hats when entering temples or someone's home. 3) Ask permission before photographing people. 4) Use your right hand for giving and receiving items. 5) Return the traditional 'sampeah' greeting (hands pressed together). 6) Speak softly and maintain composure even in frustrating situations. DON'T: 1) Touch anyone's head (considered the most sacred body part). 2) Point with your feet or sit with feet pointing toward Buddha images. 3) Show excessive public affection. 4) Touch Buddhist monks, especially if you're female. 5) Discuss politics or the Khmer Rouge period unless Cambodians bring it up first. 6) Use large denominations for small purchases—carry small bills. Respecting these customs demonstrates appreciation for Cambodian culture. Most Cambodians are forgiving of minor cultural missteps from visitors but appreciate those who make an effort to respect local traditions.",

    "question": "What is Kulen Mountain near Siem Reap?",
    "answer": "Phnom Kulen (Kulen Mountain) is a sacred mountain range about 50km from Siem Reap, significant as the birthplace of the Khmer Empire where King Jayavarman II declared independence from Java in 802 CE. Key attractions include: 1) The River of a Thousand Lingas, featuring intricate carvings of Hindu symbols on the riverbed. 2) A large reclining Buddha statue at the mountain's peak. 3) A scenic waterfall with a natural swimming pool, popular with local families. 4) Ancient temple ruins scattered throughout the area. 5) Preah Ang Thom, a Buddhist monastery with the large Buddha statue. Entrance fee is $20 per person, only payable in cash. Visit as a day trip from Siem Reap (1-1.5 hours each way), hiring a private car ($50-70) or joining a tour ($30-45 per person). The best time to visit is weekdays during dry season (November-April); weekends get very crowded with local visitors. Bring swimwear if you want to enjoy the waterfall.",
